This is a portfolio displaying Schoolwork I feel is in line with the degree's learning goal.

## Chatroom Assignment

I belive that this assignment meets the System level understanding of Computer Learning goal. For this assignment, a partner and I had to create a Chatroom that ran based on a protocol that a group of us developed in class. This assignment required us to connect a Client and Server using socket programming, threading, and various other skills we have learned to handle complete all the functionality and conditional logic. This is a very unique assignment from anything that I have done during my time at westminster, and I believe that it is a good reflection of many of the programming skills that I have come to obtain during my time at this school.

## Mathemon

This assignment is a Math-based, Pokemon-style game that is targeted towards grade-school children between 1st and 3rd grade. It was written using Angular 5 for the front-end and has a Firebase Cloud Firestore database and hosting. This was by far my largest group assignment that I have done at Westminster and definitely displays some project-based work I have done here. This project was assigned within the first 2 weeks of the semester and was finished in the last week, so it took a tremendous amount of time to complete in comparison to the average assignment that most classes gave out. In order to get it done it required me and 2 other classmates to stay in constant communication as well as collaborate in a way that allowed us to be able to reach our monthly deadlines for the tasks that we had.
