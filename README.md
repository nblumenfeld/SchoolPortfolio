# SchoolPortfolio
This is a portfolio displaying Schoolwork I feel is in line with the degree's learning goal.

## Sell Your Textbooks (SYB)
[Link to project](https://github.com/nblumenfeld/SellYourBooks)

This is my Senior Project. It is a marketplace for buying and selling used textbooks from/to other students of the same university. It was written with [React-Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and uses a [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/) as its datastorage and [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/) as it's authentication system. Follow the link to the project repo for more details about the project.

## Chatroom Assignment

Learning goal: To attain a system level understanding of the computer

For this assignment, a partner and I had to create a Chatroom that ran based on a protocol that a group of us developed in class. This assignment required us to connect a Client and Server using socket programming, threading, and various other skills we have learned to handle complete all the functionality and conditional logic. This is a very unique assignment from anything that I have done during my time at westminster, and I believe that it is a good reflection of many of the programming skills that I have come to obtain during my time at this school.

## Mathemon
[Link to project](https://github.com/aidanpirish/software_engineering_project/tree/master/Mathemon)
Learning Goal: To acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting

This assignment is a Math-based, Pokemon-style game that is targeted towards grade-school children between 1st and 3rd grade. It was written using Angular 5 for the front-end and has a Firebase Cloud Firestore database and hosting. This was by far my largest group assignment that I have done at Westminster and definitely displays some project-based work I have done here. This project was assigned within the first 2 weeks of the semester and was finished in the last week, so it took a tremendous amount of time to complete in comparison to the average assignment that most classes gave out. In order to get it done it required me and 2 other classmates to stay in constant communication as well as collaborate in a way that allowed us to be able to reach our monthly deadlines for the tasks that we had.

## Buy-Used-Textbooks Application (Android Version)
[Link to project](https://github.com/nblumenfeld/Mobile_Applications_Coursework)
Learning Goal: To understand the concepts and techniques of software design

This assignment is one that I did while I was studying abroad in Scotland. Its purpose is to serve as a marketplace to buy and sell used textbooks from other students at the same university. It was written as an Android application that used a locally stored SQLite database. It was my initial take at the concept that I ended up completing as part of me Senior project, and I belive that it is a very good demonstration of my very first large-scale object oriented program. I had to come up with not only classes that helped me to map information to my database but I also had to learn an entire framework that had various classes and lifecycle hooks that were all completely foreign to me. This was by far my largest project before I had a decent grasp on concepts like this and I think it has helped me tremendously during my senior year.

## WebServer
[Link to files](https://github.com/nblumenfeld/SchoolPortfolio/tree/master/WebServer)
Learning Goal: To acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting

This assignment was to create a web server that took a clients request and responded back with the requested page if it was found. This assignment was written in java and required me to follow HTTP protocols in order to make the request from a web browser and view what the returned page was. I believe that this assignment is a good example of another individual assignment that I have done. It functioned almost perfectly and was actually fairly fun to program. I feel like I had a very good understanding of all the concepts that were focused on within the assignment. While it wasn't my largest individual assignment, it was one that came towards the end of my career here at Westminster and shows how far I have come from the very first assignments that I have created.

## Huffman's Bit Counter
[Link to files](https://github.com/nblumenfeld/SchoolPortfolio/tree/master/Final)
Learning Goal: To develop effective problem solving skills

This program takes in a file and counts how many bits that it would be compressed to if it was to undergo a compression based on the Huffman's bit compression algorithm. This was a program written in python. I believe that this is a perfect example of the problem solving skills that I have learned here at Westminster. This by no means an easy question to answer on my database final and I believe that it is a very accurate representation of the type of problem solving that I have learned here. I was required to preform a certain task given a minimal starting point, and it required me to use what I learned in class in order to construct a solution that could have probably have been done in at least a few other ways.
